# Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-1-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my fifth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-sql-by-building-a-student-database-part-1/build-a-student-database-part-1) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my shell scripting and SQL skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-1-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the fifth of these projects I completed as part of this.

## Programming With Bash & PostgreSQL
For this project, I had to produce a Bash script that used SQL to enter information about computer science students into PostgreSQL. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-1-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). To complete this task, I cloned the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment and followed 140 Bash and SQL lessons. The notes I created when doing this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-1-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-build-a-student-database-part-1-project-guided-course-notes.txt). The CSV data that this project used exists in two files: [courses.csv](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-1-Project/blob/main/courses.csv) and [students.csv](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-1-Project/blob/main/students.csv). I created a Bash program ([insert_data.sh](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-1-Project/blob/main/insert_data.sh)) which took this and imported it into a PostgreSQL database using SQL ([students.sql](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-1-Project/blob/main/students.sql)).
