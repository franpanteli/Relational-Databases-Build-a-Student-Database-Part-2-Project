# Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-2-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my sixth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-sql-by-building-a-student-database-part-2/build-a-student-database-part-2) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my shell scripting and SQL skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-2-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the sixth of these projects I completed as part of this.

## Programming With Bash & SQL
For this project, I had to produce a Bash script that used complex SQL statements to obtain information about computer science from a database and alter said database. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-2-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). To complete this task, I cloned the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment and followed 140 Bash and SQL lessons. The notes I created when doing this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-2-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-build-a-student-database-part-2-project-guided-course-notes.txt) and my [in-depth SQL notes from completing this task are here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-2-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-build-a-student-database-part-2-project-guided-course-notes.txt). This entailed splitting the VSCode terminal with PSQL and Bash prompts. The prior prompt was used to write SQL that extracted the correct set of information from the [students.sql database](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-2-Project/blob/main/students.sql) or altered it in the desired way. Once the desired SQL statmenet was obtained, it was added to the project Bash program, [student_info.sh](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-2-Project/blob/main/student_info.sh). This was tested in the latter terminal, using `./student_info.sh`. This process was repeated for each of the SQL statments in [the project .sh file](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-2-Project/blob/main/students.sql). I created in depth SQL notes for each of these iterations [which are here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Build-a-Student-Database-Part-2-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-build-a-student-database-part-2-project-guided-course-notes.txt).
